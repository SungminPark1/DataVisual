        <h3>Info</h3>
        <p>
          Data from The Center of American Progress. Map geometry data from d3's us json. Code is in ES6.
        </p>
        <p>
          The map above shows the state poverty and unemployment rate through a redish saturation gradient.
          The usere can click on the radio buttons in the control to change the value to display. The user
          would notice that states that the three data (Poverty, Child Proverty, and Unemployment) have a
          correlation. States with higher poverty rate tend to have higher unemployment and higher child poverty
          rates. If the usere wishes to see all three rates they can hover over a state to see the exact values.
        </p>
        <p>
          The map was created using d3's geoPath and the geometry provided in the d3's us json file. D3's topojson
          was used to turn the features into useable data and also to create the state border path. Then each data point
          was manually labelled with the correct state abbr. using the data points id. This allowed the 2nd data set,
          state poverty and unemployment rate data, to be mapped to the correct state. Afterwards polish was added such
          as transition effects, radio button event listeners, etc.
